PROJECT COMPLETION SUMMARY: WPC Seat Time Estimates for LearnDash

I have successfully developed and implemented the "WPC Seat Time Estimates" plugin for LearnDash. This plugin provides automated, accurate time-to-complete estimates for courses, lessons, topics, and quizzes based on actual word counts.

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

* Automated Time Calculation:
  - Automatically calculates word counts for all LearnDash content.
  - Converts word counts into "Seat Time" (minutes) using adjustable reading speeds.
  - Strips all HTML, media, and shortcodes to ensure only readable text is measured.

* Smart Cumulative Display Model:
  - Course Level: Shows total time for the entire course (including all lessons, topics, and quizzes).
  - Lesson Level: Shows time for the lesson plus all its nested topics and quizzes.
  - Topic Level: Shows time for the topic plus its nested quizzes.
  - This ensures students see the "Total Effort" required for each section.

* Admin Configuration & Control:
  - Added a dedicated settings page under Settings > Seat Time Estimates.
  - Employers/Admins can set custom "Average" and "Slow" reading speeds (WPM).
  - Admins can customize the display label (e.g., "Estimated Seat Time:", "Time to Finish:", etc.).

* Intelligent Hierarchy Updates:
  - The plugin automatically recalculates time estimates whenever content is updated or saved.
  - If a Topic is updated, it automatically triggers a "bubble up" update to its parent Lesson and Course.

* Seamless Frontend Integration:
  - Integrates natively with LearnDash templates using standard hooks.
  - Includes a fallback display filter to ensure estimates show up even on customized themes.

* Enterprise-Ready Polish:
  - Fully secured with WordPress best practices (XSS protection, input sanitization).
  - Includes a clean uninstaller that removes all plugin data from the database if deleted.
  - Optimized performance with calculation caching.
